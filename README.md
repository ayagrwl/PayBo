# Why PayBo
> Our institute needed a payment solution for donation as well as fund collection for Student Body Clubs. There was also a need for a portal where anyone can donate money without worries about misuse. Through Paybo, we can reach everyone, including Alumnis, that wish to donate to their college.
Paybo is also meant to provide a fund for emergencies.
